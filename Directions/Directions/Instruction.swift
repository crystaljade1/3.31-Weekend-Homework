} // This function shows the possibilities Cardinal Direction any given user would be facing, based on the user's initial Cardinal Direction, if instructed to turn left or right. This is the turn function.



// Another informant heard you complain about the first set of instructions andhas tried to be simpler about it. Unfortunately, the only change is they provide a cardinal direction instead of a left or right instruction. Write a separate function which will calculate the distance between these instructions.
